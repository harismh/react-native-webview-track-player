Headless audio player for building universal music apps in React Native. Supports Android, iOS, Web, and Expo Go without requiring custom native code. Using a WebView bridge and HTML5 audio, it aims to achieve similar functionality to [react-native-track-player](https://github.com/doublesymmetry/react-native-track-player) _(see comparison table below)_.

Check out the [example app](/example) for a full-fledged music player sample.

From my experience, adopting a WebView bridge made audio playback a far more stable and consistent experience on iOS and especially Android. Plus, we gain seamless Web compatibility instead of the bundle splitting/conditional imports required when using `react-native-track-player` with React Native Web. That being said, a WebView bridge brings its own shortcomings (CORS with non-public URLs, HTML5 `<audio>` filetypes, etc.), so weigh in your own project needs carefully.

## Highlights

- Minimal core library, 1 file, ~600 SLOC.
- 1 peer dependency, `react-native-webview`.
- Expo Go, iOS Simulator, Web all work out-of-the-box with background audio and screen locking.
- Render prop pattern over manually-exposed hooks (core manages all of the state/hooks for you, so you only need to provide the UI).
- Track activity, plays, pauses, percentages listened, etc. are all automatically managed. A simple `onActivity` callback helps build analytics easily. By default, nothing is stored or transmitted.

## Installation

Using your desired package manager (npm install, yarn add, bun add, etc.), add `react-native-webview-track-player` and its one required peer dependency `react-native-webview` to your project. Eg. with npm:

```sh
npm install react-native-webview-track-player react-native-webview --save
```

If you added `react-native-webview` for the first time, refer to its [getting started guide](https://github.com/react-native-webview/react-native-webview/blob/master/docs/Getting-Started.md) if needed.

No assumptions are made on React/React Native versions or Expo SDKs. The latest of both should work without issue. As of current, the sample app is running on Expo SDK `49`, React `18.2.0`, React Native `0.72.6`, and React Native WebView `13.6.3`.

## Usage

Here is a minimal working example:

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { SafeAreaView, Text, Pressable } from "react-native";
import TrackPlayer, {
  type TrackPlayerRenderProps
} from "react-native-webview-track-player";

const playlist = [
  {
    id: "e8DPlI",
    title: "Modern",
    artist: "JM Galiè",
    audio: {
      url: "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/harismh/react-native-webview-track-player/main/.github/audio/sample.mp3"
    }
  }
];

const renderPlayer = ({ playerState, playPause }: TrackPlayerRenderProps) => (
  <SafeAreaView>
    <Pressable onPress={playPause}>
      <Text>{playerState.playing ? "Pause" : "Play"}</Text>
    </Pressable>

    <Text>Player State: {JSON.stringify(playerState)}</Text>
  </SafeAreaView>
);

const MinimalPlayer = () => (
  <TrackPlayer playlist={playlist} render={renderPlayer} />
);

export default MinimalPlayer;
```

There are many more props you can destructure or pass in to customize it further. See the [example app](/example) in the repo for a fuller example.
